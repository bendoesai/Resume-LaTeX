In short, being on the cutting edge of research and development 
is and always will be a primary motivation for my work. That is why I want 
to work at LANL, so I can push the boundaries of human knowledge in an
environment of people that want the same. I enjoy facing problems that have 
never been solved before, and I learn voraciously in order to overcome 
obstacles that face me.
