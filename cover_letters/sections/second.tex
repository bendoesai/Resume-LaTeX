\\\\
\textbf{Minimum Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Programming Experience:}  I have significant experience in both Python and C/C++ across both academic and diverse industry settings.

    \item \textbf{Operating System Experience:} I have experience developing on windows, windows-based linux systems (Cygwin, WSL), and with remote development via SSH on an Ubuntu research computing server.

    \item \textbf{Version Control System Experience:} I use git and github for as many projects as possible, to secure backups and increase portability between devices.

    \item \textbf{Collaboration/Teaming:} Currently I am Project Lead for my Senior Design team, and have worked across many small teams from 2 people to upwards of 7 in research and development settings.

    \item \textbf{Communication:} I strive for quality writing and have many opportunities to practice while writing up extensive lab reports for various engineering classes.

    \item \textbf{Education/Experience:} I plan to graduate this May with a BS in Electrical Engineering and an immersion in Applied Statistics with a GPA greater than 3.0.

\end{itemize}
\textbf{Desired Qualifications:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Satellite Senors and Programs} Throughout my 
    curriculum and co-op experiences, I have had the opportunity 
    to work across many diverse fields and apply concepts of sensor 
    application from both hardware implementation and data 
    processing sides. Through my senior design project, I have 
    learned about integrating and taking measurements from 
    a specialized SWIR sensor that uses a MEMS light filter and 
    a photodiode to detect magnitude of light across a certain 
    wavelength. I've also worked with complex real-time datasets
    in the context of titanium manufacturing. This has equipped
    me with the skills required to tackle complex, real-world
    datasets, like one that may come from a satellite using tools 
    in python such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and pytorch.
    
    \item \textbf{Scientific Algorithm Development} During all of
    my work experiences listed, I had the opportunity to use Python 
    and C/C++ to develop scientific programs 
    
    \item \textbf{Data Processing and Engineering} Familiarity with data processing pipelines and common data engineering and scientific packages
    
    \item \textbf{Unit and Integration Testing} Experience developing formalized unit and/or integration test software
    
    \item \textbf{Debugging Tools} Familiarity with debugging tools such as the GNU Debugger (GDB).
    
    \item \textbf{HDF5 and Similar Data Formats} Familiarity with Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) or other similar file formats.
\end{itemize}
