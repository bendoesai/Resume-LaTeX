\indent My experience as a software developer spans multiple industries, but across all of them 
my legacy lies in high impact, innovative, cross-disciplinary applications that provide 
lasting impact on the projects that employed me. During my time at TIMET, I had the privilege 
of spearheading a new approach to the monitoring of titanium production. My software 
development and statistical techniques directly contributed to an effort that would save the 
company millions on production defects anually. This experience is analagous to the role I 
would take up as a security engineer, where I would be responsible for novel computational 
solutions as well as modeling and assessment. I can take the lessons from this 
experience as well as every other experience since to create cohesive, manageable, efficient 
tools for the Lab's needs.
